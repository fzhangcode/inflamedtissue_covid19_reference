## Overview
This repo provides the source code for our analysis and figures on "Identification of common inflammatory macrophage phenotypes in COVID-19 using integrated transcriptional single-cell reference map of inflamed tissues in 5 diseases".

## Source code 

The code covers major analyses and figure generations for:
 - An integrative strategy for multiple disease tissue and COVID-19 integration at the single-cell level 
 - A reference by meta-analyszing > 300,000 immune cells from 125 donor including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohnâ€™s disease (CD), lupus, interstitial lung disease and COVID-19, which is effective to investigate connections between other inflammatory diseases with COVID-19.
 - Identified two common inflammatory macropahge states
 - Human blood-derived macrophages stimulated by 8 differnt cytokines and evironment using single-cell hashtag technology


## Raw data access

Upon acceptance, all single-cell hashtag sequencing data from human blood-derived macropahges  will be made available on GEO.
