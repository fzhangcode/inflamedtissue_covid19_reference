## Overview
This repo provides the source code for our analysis and figures for 

- "Fan Zhang, Joseph R. Mears, Lorien Shakib, Jessica I. Beynor, Sara Shanaj, Ilya Korsunsky, Aparna Nathan, Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (AMP RA/SLE) Consortium, Laura T. Donlin*, Soumya Raychaudhuri*. IFN-γ and TNF-α drive a CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophage phenotype expanded in severe COVID-19 lungs and inflammatory diseases with tissue inflammation. In review, 2021".

## Source code 

This repo covers major analyses and figure generations for:
 - An integrative pipeline for multiple disease tissue and COVID-19 single-cell transcriptomic integration 
 - A single-cell immune reference by meta-analyszing > 300,000 immune cells from 125 donor samples from 6 inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), lupus, interstitial lung disease, and COVID-19, which is effective to investigate connections between other inflammatory diseases with COVID-19.
 - Identification of two common inflammatory macrophage states that secreate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
 - Generation of multiple inflammatory macropahge phenotypes by stimulating human blood-derived macrophages using 8 different cytokines and evironment using single-cell hashtag technology


## Raw data access
Upon acceptance, all single-cell hashtag sequencing data from human blood-derived macropahges will be made available on GEO.
