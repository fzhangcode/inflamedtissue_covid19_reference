## Overview
This repo provides the source code for our analysis and figures on "Identification of common inflammatory macrophage phenotypes in COVID-19 using integrated transcriptional single-cell reference map of inflamed tissues in 5 diseases".

## Source code 

The code covers major analyses and figure generations for:
 - An integrative pipeline for multiple disease tissue and COVID-19 single-cell transcriptomic integration 
 - A single-cell immune reference by meta-analyszing > 300,000 immune cells from 125 donor samples from 5 inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohnâ€™s disease (CD), lupus, interstitial lung disease, and COVID-19, which is effective to investigate connections between other inflammatory diseases with COVID-19.
 - Identification of two common inflammatory macrophage states that secreate inflamamtory cytokines and chemokines
 - Generation of multiple inflammatory macropahge phenotypes by stimulating human blood-derived macrophages using 8 different cytokines and evironment using single-cell hashtag technology


## Raw data access
Upon acceptance, all single-cell hashtag sequencing data from human blood-derived macropahges will be made available on GEO.
